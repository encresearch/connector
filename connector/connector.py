"""
This program runs on the server side and subscribes to a specific topic in
order to receive information from a specific publisher (Raspberry Pi)

The devices' GAIN was chosen to be 1. Since this is a 16 bits device, the measured
voltage will depend on the programmable GAIN. The following table shows the possible
reading range per chosen GAIN. A GAIN of 1 goes from -4.096V to 4.096V.
- 2/3 = +/-6.144V
-	1 = +/-4.096V
-	2 = +/-2.048V
-	4 = +/-1.024V
-	8 = +/-0.512V
-  16 = +/-0.256V

This means that the maximum range of this 16 bits device is +/-32767.
Thus, to convert bits to V, we divide 4.096 by 32767,
which gives us 0.000125. In conclusion, to convert this readings to mV
we just need to multiply the output times 0.125, which is done in the server
side (mqtt-connector) to prevent time delays.
